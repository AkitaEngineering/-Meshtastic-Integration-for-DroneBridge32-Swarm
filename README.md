Meshtastic Drone Swarm Telemetry & Control
This project provides a framework for integrating Meshtastic mesh networking with DroneBridge32 for telemetry and control of a drone swarm.

Features:

Decentralized Control: Control your drone swarm over a Meshtastic mesh network, eliminating the need for a central ground station.
Encrypted Communication: Secure your communication with Meshtastic's built-in encryption.
Telemetry: Receive real-time telemetry data from your drones, including position, altitude, battery voltage, and more.
Control: Send commands to individual drones or the entire swarm, such as return-to-home, land, and custom commands.
MAVLink Integration: Seamlessly integrates with MAVLink for communication with flight controllers.
Error Handling: Includes robust error handling for serial communication and MAVLink parsing.
Components:

DroneBridge32 (or Companion Process): Modified DroneBridge32 code or a companion process running on each drone to handle communication with the Meshtastic node and the flight controller.
Meshtastic Node: A Meshtastic-compatible device attached to each drone.
Meshtastic Plugin: A Python-based plugin for the Meshtastic ground station software, providing a user interface for telemetry display and control.
Installation:

DroneBridge32 Integration:
Modify the DroneBridge32 code or create a companion process using the provided Arduino code.
Upload the code to your drone's flight controller or a separate microcontroller.
Meshtastic Node:
Connect a Meshtastic-compatible device to your drone.
Configure the device to join your Meshtastic network.
Meshtastic Plugin:
Install the Meshtastic Python library (pip install meshtastic).
Copy the provided Python code for the Meshtastic plugin to your ground station computer.
Run the plugin using python meshtastic_plugin.py.
Usage:

Launch the Meshtastic Plugin: The plugin will display telemetry data from the drones in your swarm.
Send Control Commands: Use the plugin's interface to send commands to individual drones or the entire swarm.
Monitor Telemetry: The plugin will update the telemetry data in real-time.
Configuration:

Drone ID: Ensure each drone has a unique ID configured in the DroneBridge32 code.
MAVLink Baud Rate: Adjust the MAVLink baud rate in the DroneBridge32 code to match your flight controller's settings.
Meshtastic Settings: Configure your Meshtastic network as needed (e.g., channel, encryption).
Additional Notes:

This project is a work in progress and may require further development and testing.
Be aware of and comply with local regulations regarding drone operation and radio communication.
